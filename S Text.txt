 
* The expression used in swtich statement must have an integral or enumerated type,or be of which 
the class has a single conversion function to an integral or enumerated type.

* the contact-exprassion for a case must be the same data type as the variable in  the switch ,and
it must be constant or a literal.
  
* When the variable being switched on is equal to case the statement following that case will
 execute until a break statement is reached.

* When a break statement is reashed the switch trminates and the flow of control jumps to the next
line following the switch  statement.

* Not every case needs to contain a break.if no break appears the flow of control will 
fall throgh to subsequnt cases until a break is 

* This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter inside the 
function the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call this means that changes
made to the parameter affect the argument.

* This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function 
In this case changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.

* A union a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same
memory loction. You can define a union with many members but only one member can contain a value
at any given time. Unions provide an effcient way of using the same memory loction for multiple-
purpose.

 * To access any members of a union use using the member access operator (.) 
The member access oprator is coded as a period between the union  variable name and the union 
members that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variable of union type.

 * While programming  if you are aware of the size of an array , then it is esay and you can define 
it as an array For example to store a name of any person, it can go up to a maximum of 100 
charaters, so you can define something as follows-

 * But now a late us considera situation where you have no idea about the legth of the text you 
need to store for example you want to store a details description about a topic. Here we need to 
define a pointer to character without defining how much memory is  required and later based on
requirement, we can allocte memory as shown in the below example-
 
 * Macros with agrument must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used .
The argument list is enclosed in  parenthese and must immediately follows the macro name .spaces
are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis For example-
